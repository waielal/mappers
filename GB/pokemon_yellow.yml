#THIS UPDATE CHANGES:
# The trash can puzzle is now accessible through the following properties:
  # events.trashCanPuzzle
  # OR
  # trainers.vermilionCityGym.gentleman3.bytes
# Syntax
  # Removed "size: 1" wherever it occurs because it is superfluous
  # Changed all "type: reference" properties to "type: int" with a reference

#OLDER MAJOR CHANGES - DOCUMENTATION (By Scott's Thoughts)

  # new
    # attack
    # defense
    # speed    
    # special
# Old properties for DVs have been replaced with new DV properties
  # old
    # dvAttackDefense
    # dvSpeedSpecial
  # new
    # dvAttack
    # dvDefense
    # dvSpeed
